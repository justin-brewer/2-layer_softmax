This is my two-layer, fully-connected network for softmax classification on the mnist dataset.

The dataset can be found on Yan Lecun's website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The network consists of a fully-connected softplus layer followed by softmax output.

This is an independent project for my machine learning lab at The University of Texas at Dallas lead by James Ryland under Dr. Richard Golden.
